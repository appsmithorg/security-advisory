# CVE-2024-55963 - Insufficient Access Control in Appsmith Restart API

## 🛡️ Summary

A vulnerability in Appsmith v1.50 allows authenticated users without administrative privileges to trigger a server restart by accessing the internal restart API. This action causes the Appsmith server to restart, resulting in a **denial of service (DoS)** condition. The flaw is due to missing access control validation for superuser permissions.

## 🧾 Details

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-55963  
- **Severity**: Medium  
- **Vulnerability Type**: Incorrect Access Control  
- **Attack Type**: Remote  
- **Affected Versions**: < Appsmith v1.50  
- **Patched Version**: Appsmith v1.52
- **Vendor**: Appsmith  



## 📍 Affected Component

The vulnerable component is the **Appsmith server restart API**, which fails to validate that only superuser-level accounts can trigger a restart. As a result, regular authenticated users can abuse this endpoint.



## 🎯 Attack Vector

An attacker must have access to an Appsmith instance and be authenticated (e.g., standard user role). By sending a request to the internal restart API, the attacker can repeatedly restart the Appsmith server container, causing service disruptions.



## 💥 Impact

- **Denial of Service**: Continual restarts can disrupt availability of the Appsmith platform for all users.
- **Scope**: The issue is limited to the Appsmith container and does not affect underlying systems or allow code execution.



## 🛠️ Mitigation

Ensure proper access control checks are enforced on sensitive API endpoints. Specifically, restrict restart functionality to superuser or admin roles only.
