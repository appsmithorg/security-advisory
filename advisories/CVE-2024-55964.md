# CVE-2024-55964 - Remote Code Execution via Misconfigured Embedded PostgreSQL in Appsmith

## 🛡️ Summary

A vulnerability in Appsmith v1.51 allows authenticated users to achieve **remote code execution (RCE)** within the Appsmith Docker container due to insecure configuration of the embedded PostgreSQL instance. By abusing the ability to create and execute queries, an attacker can run arbitrary commands on the host container.



## 🧾 Details

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-55964  
- **Severity**: High  
- **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Permissions  
- **Attack Type**: Remote  
- **Affected Versions**: < Appsmith v1.51  
- **Patched Version**: Appsmith v1.52 
- **Vendor**: Appsmith  



## 📍 Affected Component

The vulnerability lies in the **embedded PostgreSQL server** included in the Appsmith Docker image. Due to insecure permissions or misconfiguration, it is possible for authenticated users to interact with the server in a way that results in code execution inside the container.



## 🎯 Attack Vector

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must:

1. Access the Appsmith instance
2. Authenticate with a valid user account
3. Create a new PostgreSQL datasource
4. Craft and execute a malicious query

Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution inside the Appsmith container.



## 💥 Impact

- **Remote Code Execution**: Attackers can run arbitrary commands in the Appsmith container.
- **Information Disclosure**: Potential access to environment variables or sensitive container-level data.
- **Container Compromise**: Although the issue is limited to the container scope, it significantly increases risk in multi-tenant or production environments.



## 🛠️ Mitigation

Ensure the embedded PostgreSQL instance has secure permissions and configuration. Limit access and privileges of internal services to the minimum required. Refer to the [official advisory](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-m95x-4w54-gc83) for patch and mitigation status.
