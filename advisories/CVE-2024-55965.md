# CVE-2024-55965 - Information Disclosure via Improper Access Control in Appsmith Workspace View

## 🛡️ Summary

A vulnerability in Appsmith v1.50 allows users with the **“App Viewer”** role to access development-related metadata that should be restricted. Specifically, viewers can view the list of datasources configured in a workspace, despite not having permissions to interact with or modify them. While this issue does not expose secrets like database credentials or API keys, it still constitutes an information disclosure.



## 🧾 Details

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-55965  
- **Severity**: Low–Medium  
- **Vulnerability Type**: Incorrect Access Control  
- **Attack Type**: Remote  
- **Affected Versions**: < Appsmith v1.50  
- **Patched Version**: Appsmith v1.52
- **Vendor**: Appsmith  



## 📍 Affected Component

The issue exists in the **workspace permission model**, where users invited as **App Viewers** are unintentionally granted visibility into development data, including the list of datasources used in that workspace.



## 🎯 Attack Vector

An attacker must be:

1. Invited to a workspace with the **“Viewer”** role
2. Able to sign up or log in to the target Appsmith instance

Once authenticated and accepted into the workspace, they can view the list of datasources associated with that workspace through the Appsmith UI or API.



## 💥 Impact

- **Information Disclosure**: Viewers can see internal configuration metadata (e.g., datasource names/types), which may reveal internal architecture or 3rd-party integration choices.
- **No access to secrets**: Sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or API keys remain protected.



## 🛠️ Mitigation

Ensure that access control layers correctly distinguish between **metadata access** and **administrative access**. Limit visibility of development information only to roles explicitly granted development privileges.
